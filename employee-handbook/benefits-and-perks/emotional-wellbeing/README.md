# Emotional Wellbeing

Wellbeing isn’t just about your physical health. It’s also about maintaining a healthy emotional balance so you have the resilience to take on life’s stressors and cope with any big changes that come your way.

Finding a therapist \(or psychiatrist, or counsellor\) can sometimes take a while. To ease that process, Obvious will reimburse you for your first four \(4\) sessions \(upto INR 6000 in total\). These can be with the same person, or with different ones. We have a short list of therapists listed below who have come recommended.

Your sessions remain completely confidential between you and your doctor. Obvious will never ask either you or your doctor about what transpires during your sessions.

### Enabling safe conversations on emotional well-being

We need a common language to be able to create safety for each other and to have conversations on emotional well-being. To do that, we've created a framework that includes the perspectives of someone wanting to talk about their emotional health, a peer learning to be supportive, and leaders to sensitively provide support and structure.
